# Data-Projects

🎉 Welcome to the Data Projects Repository! 🎉

This repository is home to a collection of data exploration and analysis projects, each following a structured workflow:

1. 🌐 Data Collection: Data is gathered from various sources, such as Web Scraping, PDF parsing, or database access but mostly Web Scraping.

2. 💾 Data Insertion: Databases are created and the collected data is neatly stored in a database using mostly SQL.

3. 🔎 Data Analysis: Insights and patterns are extracted from the data using SQL queries and Pandas DataFrames.

4. 📈 Visualization: Results are transformed into interactive dashboards, making them easily understandable for end users.
